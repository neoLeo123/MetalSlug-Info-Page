    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p class="para">
      My name is Leo Ru, and I am an ambitious and determined student at Seneca
      College, where I am currently pursuing my passion for computer
      programming. While my journey in education began with a bachelor's degree
      in Kinesiology from York University, I soon realized that my heart lies in
      the realm of technology and programming. Driven by a desire for personal
      growth and a fulfilling career, I took a leap of faith and enrolled at
      Seneca to embark on a new path.<br />Choosing to create a website
      dedicated to Metal Slug holds a profound significance for me. This classic
      2D side-scrolling run-and-gun arcade game not only brings back cherished
      memories from my childhood but also represents the spirit of camaraderie
      and joy I shared with my sibling while playing it together. By creating
      this website, I aim to showcase my technical prowess and creative skills
      while paying tribute to a game that has left an indelible mark on my
      life.<br />In this journey of self-discovery and professional growth, I am
      excited to merge my love for programming with my innate curiosity, always
      pushing the boundaries to create impactful and engaging digital
      experiences. With each line of code I write, I am reminded of the
      limitless possibilities that lie ahead, and I am committed to making a
      positive difference in the world through the power of technology.

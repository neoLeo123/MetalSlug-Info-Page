      <h1>The History of Metal Slug</h1>
      <p class="para">
        Metal Slug dates back to the mid-1990s when it was developed by a
        company called Nazca Corporation. The key figures behind the game were
        Takashi Nishiyama and Hiroshi Matsumoto, who had previously worked on
        the Street Fighter series at Capcom. Their goal was to create a game
        that combined intense action, stunning graphics, and a sense of humor.
        The original Metal Slug game, titled "Metal Slug: Super Vehicle-001,"
        was released in 1996 for the Neo Geo arcade system. The game's success
        led to a collaboration between Nazca Corporation and SNK (Shin Nihon
        Kikaku), which later acquired Nazca to form a new division called SNK
        Playmore.

        The game's popularity in arcades quickly grew due to its engaging
        gameplay, beautifully detailed hand-drawn graphics, and innovative use
        of humor. Metal Slug stood out for its fluid animation and the ability
        to ride various vehicles, like tanks and helicopters, which added depth
        to the gameplay. Over the years, the Metal Slug franchise expanded with
        numerous sequels and spin-offs across various gaming platforms,
        including home consoles and handheld devices. Each iteration built upon
        the core gameplay mechanics, introducing new characters, vehicles, and
        weapons to keep the series fresh and exciting. The franchise's success
        also led to the release of Metal Slug collections, which bundled
        multiple games together, making the series accessible to a wider
        audience. Metal Slug became a beloved classic in the gaming community,
        praised for its nostalgic charm and challenging gameplay.

      <h1>How to play the game?</h1>
      <p class="para">
        Players start the game by choosing their character. The game can be
        played in single or double player mode. Each player has the same
        abilities and weapons, so it's mostly a matter of personal preference.
        In terms of controls, it can be played using a joystick or if you play
        it on a computer then you will be using the keyboard. Player press
        different buttons for different actions such as jumping, shooting, and
        special weapons. At the start of the game, players will be using their
        default weapon, which is a semi automatic pistol to shoot and defeat
        enemies. It can be upgraded to other weapons by picking up power ups but
        the upgraded weapon has limited ammunition while the default has
        unlimited.
      </p>

      <p class="para">
        Players can make their character jump over obstacles, platforms, and
        enemy attacks. Mastering jumping is crucial to avoid incoming fire and
        navigate the environment. Throughout the levels, you'll encounter
        various power-ups and items. These can include weapon upgrades, special
        bombs to clear the screen of enemies, health-replenishing items, and
        bonus points. At certain points in the game, you can enter and control
        various vehicles, such as tanks or armored vehicles. These vehicles
        provide additional firepower and protection, enhancing your chances of
        survival. Players will face a wide range of enemy soldiers, tanks,
        helicopters, and other machines, each with different attack patterns and
        behaviors.

      <p class="para">
        At the end of each level, you'll encounter a challenging boss fight that
        requires careful strategy and quick reflexes to defeat. Players start
        the game with a limited number of lives, and you'll lose one each time
        you're hit by an enemy or their projectiles. If you run out of lives,
        you can continue from the same spot by inserting more coins (in arcade
        versions) or selecting "continue" in home console versions. Metal Slug
        includes a scoring system, encouraging players to defeat enemies and
        collect bonuses for higher scores. High scores are often recorded for
        bragging rights and competitive play.

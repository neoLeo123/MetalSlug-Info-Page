        Metal Slug is a classic 2D side-scrolling run-and-gun arcade game
        developed by Nazca Corporation and later by SNK. It was first released
        in 1996. The game follows the adventures of a group of elite soldiers as
        they battle through various enemy-filled levels to thwart the plans of a
        sinister organization known as the Rebel Army.
